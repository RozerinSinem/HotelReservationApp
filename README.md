## Project Details

- A notification service sends an email to the manager when hotel capacity is reduced and new reservations are made.
- The admin can add hotel rooms and update existing hotel rooms.
- Users can search for hotels and rooms. Hotel prices vary depending on the number of guests. Users receive a 10% discount when they log in.
- When users view the details of a hotel, they see the rooms they can book. When a reservation is made, the capacity of the hotel room decreases based on the number of guests. Reservation details are sent to the admin by email.
